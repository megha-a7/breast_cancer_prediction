# Breast Cancer Prediction Using Machine Learning
Dataset used - Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set --> https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data

In this project I have built a Logistic regression model, Decision Tree Classifier and Random Forest Classifier using Scikit-learn to classify breast cancer as either Malignant or Benign. Then calculate model accuracy using confusion matrix and finally compare our model's prediction with the actual prediction. Also here a simple expolatory data analysis is done where visualization using countplot, pairplot and correlation(heatmap) is done. ![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/82528894/144289237-ad7682c8-b309-4503-933b-1dbe8bd99b71.JPG)
